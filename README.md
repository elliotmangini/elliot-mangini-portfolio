TO DO


PROBLEMS
<!-- -Make 3 more videos -->

<!-- ??????? -->
<!-- -glitch where elements flash in between project selection and theatre -->

<!-- -the play button needs to not linger and has bugs -->
<!-- -matrix text has bugs -->
<!-- -fix resume formatting -->
<!-- -the main button to go to the case study needs to work EVERY time -->
<!-- -i believe it is the cube's movement that is causing scroll problems on mobile -->
<!-- -the NEXT FILM button needs to work -->
<!-- -cycle buttons take too long to come in -->
<!-- -on refresh the page looks bad/glitchy, we need a cover fadeout, maybe i reincorporate the enter splashscreen -->
<!-- -when a film finishes, it should ask the user if they want to get in contact with me, or watch another film -->
<!-- -prevent the sending of a message if all fields are not valid -->
<!-- -lighting inconsistency in transition to theatre -->
<!-- -when you click resume from project focus the list comes back -->

VIDEO IMPROVEMENTS
fast-forward clock
fix glitch edit into “choose your vibe”
make sure the upper right indicators are on screen despite curtains
-add autogenerated captions


<!-- add a pdf download of my resume -->
<!-- putting the name of the project where the tagline is now -->
<!-- do the whole broken cube thing -->
<!-- background video doesnt stick to the main size -->
Expand on the descriptions so they are a bit longer
the quick-look can be wider on mobile

Watch Walkthrough instead of where the title is now
add video playback controls
the playability doesnt really work on mobile because of the full screening
hitbox on the go to video button is fucked.
fix the full screen little video glitch with the mask thing

<!-- font-weight 800 as an example of css for bolding -->
<!-- italicize the tagline -->
use UL and LI for the languages being used

resume formatting - italicize some of the nouns and buzzwords
wrap that stuff in a P (font-weight 500)

back and forward arrows look weird

use li before and after decoration to do styling

using before and after
AS WELL AS
notoftype last

transition using scalable font sizes— because you cant zoom in on them.

change the devblog icon to something that looks more like a blog XXX
-for each button at the bottom do a tooltip XXXX

Title swingaway animation gets retriggered with the matrix text efect

remove technical projects from resume

add more—

add a Personal Interests / Skills section to my resume “unique and approachable”

Reword my resume so that the things I’ve done are more related to ME and less related to the technical projects.

how to build a database
had to build a backend routing framework
how to build a frontend
basics of CSS javascript
how asynchronous patterns work

WISHES
-incorporate more of the gifs I made
-overall site is too dark
-add the "please contact me" popup thing
-the cycle button project-switching deserve a different animation
-the cube can be reused on the quick details page but in its glitch state only and top right, blurring in and out as well, smaller
-escape button should go from details to main page, and there should be an esc key on the top right of those details
-enter key in between the forward and backwards buttons that does te same thing as clicking.
-escape key should also exit the resume page, but not the message page
-when the quick details are in phone mode, they could maybe be wider
-the arrow gif is a bit close, the masked title could come down a little bit, and also there seems to be a scroll problem but only on mobile
-on mobile the video can sit right at the top, and the bottom part of the screen can be used for something else.
-the Exit Theatre and Next Film buttons need to come down slightly
-on successful message send, put an easter egg sequence
-main cube has the whole animation vs transition problem

STRETCH GOALS:

Sound implementation:
-impact relating to the enter screen
-big deep glowing drony sound relating to the cube
-glassy swooshy sound on details look
-then when the glitched cube comes in some electrical fire sounds
-stone sliding sound on cycle through projects
-dramatic sequence into silence and then curtain/theatre/audience sounds for theatre
-crickets sound after a video finishes
-ASMRy keyboard click sounds for the social link buttons
-beepy  sounds for resume
-old-school email sound for email, which swoops into digital silence, which then makes the easter egg sequence more dramatic

THEN DEPLOY on AWS AMPLIFY or GitHub Pages!!!!

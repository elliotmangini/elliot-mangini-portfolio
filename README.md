Portfolio to do


PROBLEMS
-Make 3 more videos

-glitch where elements flash in between project selection and theatre
<!-- -the play button needs to not linger and has bugs -->
<!-- -matrix text has bugs -->
<!-- -fix resume formatting -->
<!-- -the main button to go to the case study needs to work EVERY time -->
-i believe it is the cube's movement that is causing scroll problems on mobile
-the NEXT FILM button needs to work
-cycle buttons take too long to come in
-on refresh the page looks bad/glitchy, we need a cover fadeout, maybe i reincorporate the enter splashscreen
-when a film finishes, it should ask the user if they want to get in contact with me, or watch another film
-prevent the sending of a message if all fields are not valid
-lighting inconsistency in transition to theatre
-when you click resume from project focus the list comes back


WISHES
-incorporate more of the gifs I made
-overall site is too bright
-add the "please contact me" popup thing
-the cycle button project-switching deserve a different animation
-the cube can be reused on the quick details page but in its glitch state only and top right, blurring in and out as well, smaller
-escape button should go from details to main page, and there should be an esc key on the top right of those details
-enter key in between the forward and backwards buttons that does te same thing as clicking.
-escape key should also exit the resume page, but not the message page
-when the quick details are in phone mode, they could maybe be wider
-the arrow gif is a bit close, the masked title could come down a little bit, and also there seems to be a scroll problem but only on mobile
-on mobile the video can sit right at the top, and the bottom part of the screen can be used for something else.
-the Exit Theatre and Next Film buttons need to come down slightly
-on successful message send, put an easter egg sequence
-main cube has the whole animation vs transition problem

STRETCH GOALS:

Sound implementation:
-impact relating to the enter screen
-big deep glowing drony sound relating to the cube
-glassy swooshy sound on details look
-then when the glitched cube comes in some electrical fire sounds
-stone sliding sound on cycle through projects
-dramatic sequence into silence and then curtain/theatre/audience sounds for theatre
-crickets sound after a video finishes
-ASMRy keyboard click sounds for the social link buttons
-beepy  sounds for resume
-old-school email sound for email, which swoops into digital silence, which then makes the easter egg sequence more dramatic

THEN DEPLOY on AWS AMPLIFY or GitHub Pages!!!!
